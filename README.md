# Kmeans-OpenMP
Naive Kmeans implementation in C using OpenMP to test different multi-thread architectures for scalability comparisons.

### Note:
"project.pdf! contains a complete overview of the project structure as well as some comparisons and a discussion on some scalability issues. These dataset (provided in the "data" folder) are quite small, but some more tests can be performed with different artificially synthesized input files.
